# mlth.data.frame

This is a package to define, manipulate and write the 'multi-header' dataframes, or nested dataframes.
It also provides functionality to write the dataframe into Excel spreadsheets and to adjust its appearance
(e.g., fonts, borders etc). The 'xlsx' package is used for this.

The development is still ongoing, the feedback is welcome.
